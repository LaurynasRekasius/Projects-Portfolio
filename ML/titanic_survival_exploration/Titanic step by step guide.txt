1. install anaconda 2.7

2. download the project from Udacity GitHub folder
	- on the website fork the folder . this https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning or only titanic folder
	- then grab the link from website to your forked folder like https://github.com/lrekasius/machine-learning.git
	- download loacaly. in the git bach navigate to the folder where you want to download and use 'git clone https://github.com/lrekasius/machine-learning.git'
	
2. open command prompt and navigate to the downloaded files
	- to change the driver letter jest enter 'd:' and press enter
	- then use cd to navigate to titanic folder. You can use TAB to autocpmplete folder names
	- when in the folder enter 'jupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb'
	
3. You need to know how to write 'if' statements in Python. For example:
	-  if (passenger['Sex'] == 'female') or (passenger['Sex'] == 'male' and passenger['Age'] < 10):
            predictions.append(1)
        else:
            predictions.append(0)
	- It is also good to know how to define variables
        sex = passenger['Sex']
        age = passenger['Age']
        pclass = passenger['Pclass']

4. Explore more in deep the data set. In other words continue to build desicion tree. 
	- To get accuracy above 80% I explored the fallowing variables: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch. 
	  I looked at different variables cuts by age and sex and this let me conclude that men survival rate also dependent not only the age,
	  but also on the ticket class they had. Higher class = higher chance of survival, so this observation let me to increase young boys age 
	  who survived from 10 years old to 16 and this resulted in 80.02% accuracy. However, I continued to investigate how to increase 
	  prediction among women. I found out that women in the lowest class and around 40-50 years old also had higher mortality. 
	  By joining together these two observations I was able to reach 80.92% accuracy for model. 
	- if (passenger['Sex'] == 'female'):
            if (passenger['Pclass'] == 3 and passenger['Age'] > 40 and passenger['Age'] < 50 ):
                predictions.append(0)
            else:
                predictions.append(1)   
        elif (passenger['Sex'] == 'male'):
            if  (passenger['Age'] < 16 and passenger['Pclass'] < 3):
                 predictions.append(1)
            else:
                predictions.append(0)
